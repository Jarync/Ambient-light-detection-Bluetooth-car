The circuit connection diagram is based on the fritzing diagram and Figure 2. For L298N, connect the two enable pins by wire for left and also right(near out1 and out4)

Use batery 2 18650, AA batery inability to meet the current requirements needed for driving.

for arduino R4, if use bluetooth module via the uart protocl, pls using Serial port 1 not 0, if Srial0, R4 cannot get the chart from device (check from datasheet)
